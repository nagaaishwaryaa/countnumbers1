# countnumbers1
# python code to count number of positive,negative,zero in a list
This script does the following:
1.
We define a function count_number_types that takes a list of numbers as input.
2.
Inside the function, we initialize counters for positive, negative, and zero numbers.
3.
We iterate through each number in the list and increment the appropriate counter based on whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.
4.
The function returns a tuple containing the counts of positive, negative, and zero numbers.
5.
In the example usage, we create a sample list of numbers and call the function with this list.
6.
Finally, we print the results.
